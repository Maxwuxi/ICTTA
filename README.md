Official implementation of the paper **"Dynamic Adaptation for Class-Imbalanced Streams: An Imbalanced Continuous Test-Time Framework"** (accepted at a top-tier conference).  
**ICTTA** is a novel framework designed to address class imbalance in dynamically evolving test data streams, significantly improving model robustness under continuous domain shifts.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods often assume balanced test data distributions, which rarely hold in real-world scenarios. **ICTTA** tackles this challenge by:
- **Dynamic Adaptive Loss**: Assigns sample-wise weights to prioritize minority classes while preserving majority class performance.
- **Class-Aware Adaptation**: Leverages confidence margins to adjust optimization focus dynamically.
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Provably enhances minority class adaptation under imbalanced streaming data.

**Key Results**:
- Achieves **16.5%** mean classification error on CIFAR10-C and **68.1%** on ImageNet-C.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods (e.g., TENT, CTTA) in precision, recall, and F1-score.
