Official implementation of the paper **"Dynamic Adaptation for Class-Imbalanced Streams: An Imbalanced Continuous Test-Time Framework"** (accepted at a top-tier conference).  
**ICTTA** is a novel framework designed to address class imbalance in dynamically evolving test data streams, significantly improving model robustness under continuous domain shifts.

## üìå Overview

Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods often assume balanced test data distributions, which rarely hold in real-world scenarios. **ICTTA** tackles this challenge by:
- **Dynamic Adaptive Loss**: Assigns sample-wise weights to prioritize minority classes while preserving majority class performance.
- **Class-Aware Adaptation**: Leverages confidence margins to adjust optimization focus dynamically.
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Provably enhances minority class adaptation under imbalanced streaming data.

**Key Results**:
- Achieves **16.5%** mean classification error on CIFAR10-C and **68.1%** on ImageNet-C.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods (e.g., TENT, CTTA) in precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maxwuxi/ICTTA.git
   cd ICTTA
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run ICTTA on CIFAR10-C with a WideResNet-28-10 model:
### CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C-standard task
```bash
cd cifar
# This includes the comparison of all three methods as well as baseline
bash run_cifar10.sh
### ImageNet-to-ImageNetC task 
```bash
# Tested on RTX3090
cd imagenet
bash run.sh
```
